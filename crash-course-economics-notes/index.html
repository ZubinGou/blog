<p>The following notes are basically taken from youtube comments.</p>
<h2 id="ch1-fundamentals-of-economics">CH1 Fundamentals of Economics</h2>
<h3 id="s1-intro">s1 Intro</h3>
<ul>
<li>ECONOMICS is the study of people and choices.</li>
<li>Two assumption
<ul>
<li>SCARCITY</li>
<li>Everything has COST</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>OPPORTUNITY COST is whatever you give up to do something.</li>
<li>SCARCITY is the tension between infinite wants and finite resources.</li>
<li>INCENTIVES is a set of external (rather than intrinsic) motivators that explain people’s choices.</li>
<li>MACROECONOMICS is the study of production, employment, prices, and policies on a nationwide scale.</li>
<li>MICROECONOMICS is the study of how consumers, workers, and firms interact to generate outcomes in specific markets.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="s2-specialization-and-trade">s2 Specialization and Trade</h3>
<ul>
<li>Economics is the study of scarcity and choices. We have limited resources, so we need a way to analyze the best way to use them.</li>
<li>Significant sustained increase in people’s lives happened after Industrial Revolution.</li>
<li>Adam Smith concluded that division of labor made countries wealthy.
<ul>
<li>Analogy: one pizza takes few people to be created. One prepares ingredients, another puts it in the oven, another one puts it in the box. This division makes each worker more productive, since each one is focused on a thing they do best and they don’t need to spend time switching between the tasks.</li>
<li>Without specializations, if you want something - you have to make it yourself.</li>
<li>So if you are good at producing something - specialize at it and then trade with others.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Production Possibilities Frontier (PPF) shows different combinations of two goods being produced using all resources efficiently.
<ul>
<li>Every possible combination inside the curve is inefficient. On the curve - efficient. Outside - impossible.</li>
<li>The country that can produce more goods of one kind (per time) than another country is having an absolute advantage over another country in production of those goods.</li>
<li>Opportunity cost is a cost of production of good, measured in losses in production of another good.</li>
<li>Country that can produce good with cheaper opportunity cost, has comparative advantage over another country.</li>
<li>Individuals and countries should specialize in producing things in which they have a comparative advantage and then trade with other countries that specialize in something else. This trade is mutually beneficial.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>If there is one point where economists agree it’s that specialization and trade makes the world better off.</li>
<li>Self-sufficiency is inefficiency</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="s3-economic-systems-and-macroeconomics">s3 Economic Systems and Macroeconomics</h3>
<ul>
<li>As a social order, we have to figure out three things:
<ul>
<li>What will we produce?</li>
<li>How to produce it?</li>
<li>Who will get it?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Two different economic systems: market economies and planned economies.
<ol>
<li>In planned economy, government controls labor, land and capital.</li>
<li>Communism is primarily defined by the lack of private property. Class-lessness is a symptom of having no private property. There are no communist countries in the world.</li>
<li>Often socialism has some private property and some public ownership.</li>
<li>Command economy is totally controlled by government.</li>
<li>In market economies, individuals control production to get profit. Invisible hand - the unintended social benefits resulting from individual actions. “It’s not from the benevolence of the butcher, the brewer, or the baker, that we expect our dinner, but from the regard to their own interest.” The mechanism of the invisible hand is that if you produce unwanted or shoddy products, a competitor will produce better more desirable products and put you out of business. This results in businesses that produce the things that people want/demand most, at lower prices.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Modern economies are neither completely free market nor planned. There’s a spectrum of government involvement.</li>
<li>Circular flow model.
<ul>
<li>Modern economy is made above households (individuals like him and you) and businesses.</li>
<li>Businesses sell goods and services to households in product market.</li>
<li>Households earn the money by selling labor to businesses.</li>
<li>Businesses pay for the resources on resource market.</li>
<li>Government also buys products and resources, i.e. to buy cars from businesses and hire policemen to drive them.</li>
<li>Government gets the money from taxes, households and businesses (and borrowing).</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="s4-supply-and-demand">s4 Supply and Demand</h3>
<ul>

<h3 id="s5-macroeconomics">s5 Macroeconomics</h3>
<ul>
<li>Macroeconomics: the study of the entire economy as a whole rather than individual markets.</li>
<li>In general policy makers try to achieve three goals:
<ul>
<li>Keep the economy growing over time (gross domestic product - GDP)</li>
<li>Limit unemployment (unemployment rate)</li>
<li>Keep prices stable (inflation rate)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>GDP is the value of all final goods and services produced within a country’s border in a specific period of time, usually a year.
<ul>
<li>Transactions where nothing new was produced - don’t count as GDP.</li>
<li>Also not including illegal activities.</li>
<li>Measured in dollars.</li>
<li>Nominal GDP is GDP not adjusted for inflation.</li>
<li>Real GDP is GDP adjusted for inflation.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Recession: when two successful quarters, or six months, show a decrease in real GDP.
<ul>
<li>Depression - a severe recession.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Unemployment rate is calculated by taking the number of people that are unemployed and dividing by the number of people in the labor force, times 100.
<ul>
<li>Discouraged workers - unemployed people that were looking for work, but have given up.</li>
<li>There are three types of unemployment:
<ol>
<li>frictional unemployment - the time period between jobs, when a worker is searching for, or transitioning from one job to another.</li>
<li>structural unemployment - unemployment caused by lack of demand for a worker’s specific type of labor.</li>
<li>cyclical unemployment - unemployment due to recession.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Natural rate of unemployment - the lowest rate of unemployment that economy can sustain over a long period.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>inflation - an increase in a currency supply relative to the number of people using it, resulting in rising prices of goods and services over time.
<ul>
<li>Deflation - a decrease in general price level of goods and services.</li>
</ul>

<li>Lack of natural resources.</li>
<li>Corrupt governments.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>GDP per capita(output per person) is used to tell how wealthy a country is.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Countries with high GDP/capita have far less infant mortality, poverty and preventable diseases.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Productivity and growth:</p>
<ol>
<li>The more a worker produces, the more a worker can earn.</li>
<li>Economists argue that the main reason that some countries are rich is because of productiivty.</li>
<li>Higher value produce also the growth effect.</li>
<li>Productivity is key, but there are limits.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>People in poor countries need food, water, plumbing, hospitals and medicine, and all of those things are needed to get better efficiency.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How much stuff is produced per person(can be called GDP)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Factors of production effect the efficiency:</p>
<ol>
<li>Land</li>
<li>Workers</li>
<li>Capital( and also workers education, knowledge aka human capital)</li>
<li>Technology: The sum total of knowledge and information that society has acquired concerning the use of resources to produce goods and services. (Connectivity= productivity).</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>Increasing Productivity has resulted in increasing standards of living(globally and historically).</p>

<ul>
<li>The Federal Reserve is the central bank of US. Europe has the European Central Bank. Most Central Banks have two jobs:
<ol>
<li>they regulate and oversee the nation’s commercial banks by making sure that banks have enough money in reserve to avoid bank runs.</li>
<li>they conduct monetary policy which is increasing or decreasing the money supply to speed up or slow down the overall economy.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>interest rate - the price of borrowing money.
<ul>
<li>When interest rates are low, borrowers will find it easier to pay back loans so they will borrow more and spend more. When interest rates are high, borrowers borrow less and spend less.</li>
<li>Expansionary monetary policy: when central bank wants to speed up the economy, it will increase the money supply, which will decrease interest rates and lead to more borrowing and spending.</li>
<li>Contractionary monetary policy: when central bank wants to slow down the economy, they decrease the money supply. Less money available will increase interest rates and decrease borrowing and spending.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Liquid assets: an asset that can be converted into cash quickly and with minimal impact to the price received.</li>
<li>3 main ways to change money supply:
<ol>

<li>Equity: the difference between the value of the assets/interest and the cost of liabilities of something owned.</li>
<li>Financial instrument: a tradeable asset of any kind.</li>
<li>Financial institution - an establishment that conducts financial transactions such as investments, loans and deposits.</li>

<ul>
<li>Hyperinflation: when a country experiences a monthly inflation rate of over 50% or around 13,000% annual inflation.
<ul>
<li>Extreme inflation also forces people to spend as quickly as possible rather than save of lend, so there is no money available to fund new businesses. And all that uncertainty limits foreign investment and trade.</li>
<li>The more money you print, the more inflation you get.</li>
<li>Economists call the number of times a dollar is spent per year a velocity of money. When people spend their money as quickly as they get it, that increases velocity, which pushes inflation up even faster.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Depression. After the initial crash in 1929 the federal reserve dropped interest rates to zero, output and prices fell, and regular people started to expect further price declines. Unemployment rose to 25% and the average family income dropped by around 40%.</li>
<li>Stagflation: when output slows down or stops, or stagnates at the same time that prices rise. Stagnant economy + inflation = stagflation.
<ul>
<li>The FED tried to address this by boosting the money supply and cutting interest rates, but output couldn’t rise much because of low productivity and the oil shortage. So all that extra money just triggered inflation.</li>

<li>Economic theories are constantly been proven, disproven and revised. The problem is, when these theories are wrong, millions of people can be adversely affected.</li>
<li>The founder of modern economics was a Scottish philosopher, named Adam Smith. In 1776 his book “The wealth of nations” was published. It was an organized discussion about economic theory.
<ul>
<li>When both focus on what they’re best at and then trade, everyone benefits.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>In 1890 was published a book, called “Principles of economics” by Alfred Marshall. It embodied classical economics.</li>
<li>In 1936 John Maynard Keynes published a book “A general theory of money” which launched a field of macroeconomics.
<ul>
<li>They claimed that during recessions it is necessary for the government to get involved by using monetary and fiscal policy to increase output and decrease unemployment.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Socialism: system where the means of producing and distributing goods is owned collectively or by a centralized government.</li>
<li>Monetarism: focused on price stability and argue the money supply should be increased slowly and predictably to allow for steady growth.</li>
<li>Supply side economics (trickle down economics): advocated deregulation and cutting taxes, especially corporate taxes.</li>

The question is, what level of inequality is acceptable? And when does inequality start doing more harm than good?” - Bill Gates - Some economists argue greater income inequality is associated with increased violence, drug abuse, incarceration, diluted political equality (rich have disproportionate say in what policies advance and in this have an incentive to promote their own self-interest) - Solutions - Education, increased minimum wage, affordable, high quality childcare, provide a social safety net, adjustment of tax code to redistribute income - Increase income taxes and capital taxes on the rich - Progressive tax - a tax in which the tax rate increases as the taxable amount increases - “One idea is to fix loopholes that the rich use to avoid paying taxes. Other economists argue that taxing the rich won’t be as effective as reducing regulation and bureaucratic red tape.” - No society can surely be flourishing and happy of which the far greater part of the members are poor and miserable - Adam Smith</p>

<li>subsidize products that reduce pollution (electric cars, renewable energy)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>how can technology help?
<ul>
<li>since our current technology doesn’t provide cheaper renewable energy, we can maximize the use of non renewable energy (energy-efficient cars)</li>
<li>rebound effect: efforts to increase energy efficiency creates more available energy that only gets spent into something MORE and MORE.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>what actions are the world taking?
<ol>
<li>International treatys in which countries commit on reducing greenhouse gases emission. (UN negotiations)</li>
<li>funding “green” research into renewable energy.</li>
<li>changes can be brought by individual consumers, along with changes by the government and producers. (turn the lights off when not in use! and other small things).</li>

<ul>
<li>
<p>4 types of markets</p>
<ol>
<li>Perfect competition: Low barriers, identical products, no control over price (eg strawberries)</li>
<li>Monopoly: There is one large company that produces a product with few substitutes. And because high barriers prevent competition, a monopoly has a lot of control over price.</li>
<li>Monopolistic competition: a market with many producers and relatively low barriers; their products are very similar but not identical. (eg furniture stores or fast food)</li>
<li>Oligopolies: markets that have high barriers to entry and are controlled by a few large companies. Similar to monopolistic competition, their products are similar but not identical. That gives them some control over their prices. How?</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>Non-price competition: Companies focus on things like style, quality, location, or service. The goal is to distinguish their product from their competitors.</p>
<ul>
<li>The most recognizable form of non-price competition is advertising.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Game theory: the study of strategic decision making.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Collusion: If businesses don’t compete at all and they agree to charge the same high price, conspiring to form what economists call a cartel. They split the customers 50⁄50, but now they make even more profit – benefiting at the expense of consumers. It’s illegal in the US.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Price leadership is when one company changes its prices, and its competitors have to decide if they’re going to follow suit.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Pay off matrix: In game theory, a payoff matrix is a table in which strategies of one player are listed in rows and those of the other player in columns and the cells show payoffs to each player such that the payoff of the row player is listed first.</p>
